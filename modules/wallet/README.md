 - Update layout of this README to match Renter README. (ie subsystems, key files, links, etc)

### Wallet Encryption Subsystem

This section gives an overview of how encryption is handled within the Uplo wallet and refers to the source code within `encrypt.go`. The encryption within the wallet is done using the Twofish cipher in Galois Counter Mode and hashing is done using the Blake2B algorithm.

The following pieces of information are currently being encrypted by the wallet:
- [Masterkey](#masterkey)
- [Seed](#seed-encryption)

#### Masterkey

The masterkey is a key that is either derived from a custom password provided by the user or the wallet seed if no custom password is provided. Either way, the custom password or seed are hashed before being used as the masterkey to encrypt/decrypt the wallet to produce exactly 32 bytes of entropy for the Twofish cipher. The masterkey itself is also never used directly to encrypt any data. Instead it is used with the wallet's UID to derive a key to encrypt the seed.

To allow the user to recover the wallet after forgetting a custom password, the masterkey is encrypted and stored within the wallet's BoltDB bucket. In this case the encryption key used is derived from the primary seed and the wallet's UID.

#### Seed Encryption

To protect the user's primary seed, the so-called `seedFile` is encrypted before being stored on disk within the wallet's BoltDB bucket. This file contains the primary seed, a random UID and the encrypted verification plaintext. The UID is used to derive a key to encrypt the verification plaintext from the masterkey and the verification plaintext can be used to verify that decrypting the seed was successful. This is done by decrypting the seedFile and then decrypting the verification plaintext and comparing it to the expected plaintext in the `verificationPlaintext`constant. Without the verification plaintext this wouldn't be possible since both the UID and the seed are random entropy.

#### Locking / Unlocking the Wallet

"Locking" and "Unlocking" the wallet refers to the process of wiping sensitive data from memory and loading the encrypted data from disk into memory and decrypting it respectively. The following fields are wiped by the wallet's `wipeSecrets` method when the wallet is locked.

- `w.keys`        // secret keys derived from seeds
- `w.seeds`       // imported seeds
- `w.primarySeed` // wallet's primary seed

#### Changing the password

There are 2 ways to change the wallet's password. Either by providing the current masterkey which allows the wallet to decrypt the data on disk and reencrypt it using a new key or by using the primary seed. The latter will use the seed to retrieve the masterkey from disk and then use it to reencrypt the wallet.

# Contractor

The Contractor is responsible for forming and renewing file contracts with
hosts. Its goal is to manage the low-level details of the negotiation, revision,
and renewal protocols, such that the renter can operate at a higher level of
abstraction. Ideally, the renter should be mostly ignorant of the Uplo protocol,
instead focusing on file management, redundancy, and upload/download algorithms.

The Contractor is also responsible for various forms of contract maintenance
including contract recovery, utility checking, archiving, and monitoring its own
contracts using the watchdog subsystem.

## Design Challenges

The primary challenge of the Contractor is that it must be smart enough for the
user to feel comfortable allowing it to spend their money. Because contract
renewal is a background task, it is difficult to report errors to the user and
defer to their decision. For example, what should the Contractor do in the
following scenarios?

- The contract set is up for renewal, but the average host price has increased,
  and now the allowance is not sufficient to cover all of the user's uploaded
  data.

- The user sets an allowance of 10 hosts. The Contractor forms 5 contracts, but
  the rest fail, and the remaining hosts in the HostDB are too expensive.

- After contract formation succeeds, 2 of 10 hosts become unresponsive. Later,
  another 4 become unresponsive.

Waiting for user input is dangerous because if the contract period elapses, data
is permanently lost. The Contractor should treat this as the worst-case
scenario, and take steps to prevent it, so long as the allowance is not
exceeded. However, since the Contractor has no concept of redundancy, it is not
well-positioned to determine which sectors to sacrifice and which to preserve.
The Contractor also lacks the ability to reupload data; it can download sectors,
but it does not know the decryption keys or erasure coding metadata required to
reconstruct the original data. It follows that these responsibilities must be
delegated to the renter.

## Alerts

`WalletLockedDuringMaintenance` is registered if the wallet is locked while the
contractor is attempting to create contracts.

`AllowanceLowFunds`  is registered if the contractor lacks the necessary fund to
renew or form contracts.

## TODOs
* [ ] (watchdog) Perform action when storage proof is found and when missing at the end of the window.
* [ ] (watchdog) Add renter dependencies in `sweepContractInputs` if necessary.


## Subsystems
The Contractor is split up into the following subsystems:
- [Allowance](#allowance-subsystem)
- [Contract Maintenance Subsystem](#contract-maintenance-subsystem)
- [Churn Limiter Subsystem](#churn-limiter-subsystem)
- [Recovery Subsystem](#recovery-subsystem)
- [Session Subsystem](#session-subsystem)
- [Persistence Subsystem](#persistence-subsystem)
- [Watchdog Subsystem](#watchdog-subsystem)


## Allowance Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [Allowance](./allowance.go)

The allowance subsystem is used for setting and cancelling allowances. A change
in allowance does not necessarily cause changes in contract formation.

### Exports
- `SetAllowance` is exported by the `Contractor` and allows the caller to
  dictate the contract spendings of the `Renter`.

### Outbound Complexities
- `callInterruptContractMaintenance` is used when setting the allowance to
  stop and restart contract maintenance with the new allowance settings in
  place.


## Contract Maintenance Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [contractmaintenance.go](./contractmaintenance.go)

The contract maintenance subsystem is responsible for forming and renewing
contracts, and for other general maintenance tasks.

### Contract Formation

Contract formation does not begin until the user first calls `SetAllowance`. An
allowance dictates how much money the Contractor is allowed to spend on file
contracts during a given period. When the user calls `SetAllowance` the
[Allowance subsystem](#allowance-subsytem) updates the allowance and restarts the
Maintenance subsystem so that it will form new contracts with the changed
settings. New contracts will only be formed if needed and if the allowance is
sufficiently greater than the previous allowance, where "sufficiently greater"
currently means "enough money to pay for at least one additional sector on every
host." This allows the user to increase the amount of available storage
immediately, at the cost of some complexity.

The Contractor forms many contracts in parallel with different host, and tries
to keep all the contracts "consistent" -- that is, they should all have the same
storage capacity, and they should all end at the same height. Hosts are selected
from the HostDB. There is no support for manually specifying hosts, but the
Contractor will not form contracts with multiple hosts within the same subnet.

**Contract Renewal**

Contracts are automatically renewed by the Contractor at a safe threshold before
they are set to expire. This value is set in the allowance. When contracts are
renewed, they are renewed with the current allowance, which may differ from the
allowance that was used to form the initial contracts. In general, this means
that allowance modifications only take effect upon the next "contract cycle".

### Other Maintenance Checks

- Check the contract set for **duplicate contracts** and remove them.
- **Prune hosts**  that are no longer used for any contracts and hosts that violate rules about address ranges
- **Check the utility of opened contracts** by figuring out which contracts are still useful for uploading or for renewing
- **Archive contracts** which have expired by placing them in a historic contract set.

### Inbound Complexities
- `threadedContractMaintenance` is called by the
  [Allowance subsystem](#allowance-subsystem) when setting allowances, when `CancelContract`
  is called from the `Contractor`, and also with every `ConsensusChange` by the
  `Contractor` in the `ProcessConsensusChange` when the `Contractor` is synced.
- `callInterruptContractMaintenance` is used by [Allowance
  subsystem](#allowance-subsystem) when setting the allowance to
  stop and restart contract maintenance with the new allowance settings in
  place.
- `callNotifyDoubleSpend` is a Contract Maintenance call used by the watchdog to
  indicate that a contract is double-spent and triggers actions from the
  Contractor.

### Outbound Complexities
- `callInitRecoveryScan` in the [Recovery subsystem](#recovery-subsystem) is
  called to scan blocks for recoverable contracts.
- `save` is called to persist the contractor whenever the `Contractor's` state
  is updated during maintenance.
- Funds established by the [Allowance subsystem](#allowance-subsystem) are used
  and deducted appropriately during maintenance to form and renew contracts.
- `callNotifyChurnedContract` is used when a contract utility changes from GFR
  to !GFR.
- `threadedSendMostRecentRevision` in the [Watchdog subsystem](#watchdog-subsystem)
   is called when a contract is renewed and no new revisions are expected.


## Churn Limiter Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [churnlimiter.go](./churnlimiter.go)

The Churn Limiter is responsible for decreasing contract churn. It keeps track
of the aggregate size of all contracts churned in the current period. Churn is
limited by keeping contracts with low-scoring hosts around if the maximum
aggregate for the period has been reached.

### Exports
- `SetMaxPeriodChurn` is exported by the `Contractor` and allows the caller
   to set the maximum allowed churn in bytes per period.

### Inbound Complexities
- `callNotifyChurnedContract` is used when contracts are marked GFR after
   previously being !GFR.
- `callBumpChurnBudget` is used to increase the churn budget when new blocks
   are processed.
- `callResetAggregateChurn` resets the aggregate churn and is called every
   time the contractor enters a new period.
- `callPersistData` is called whenever the contractor's `persistData` is
   called.


## Recovery Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [recovery.go](./recovery.go)

The Contractor is also responsible for scanning the Uplo blockchain and
recovering all unexpired contracts which belong to the current wallet seed. The
relevant contracts are found by examining the contract identifier attached to
every file contract. Recovery scans are initiated whenever the wallet is
unlocked or when a new seed is imported.

A recoverable contract is recovered by reinitiating a session with the relevant
host and by getting the most recent revision from the host using this session.

### Inbound Complexities
- `callInitRecoveryScan` is called in the [Maintenance
  subsystem](#contract-maintenance-subsystem) to initiate recovery scans.
- `callRecoverContracts` is called in the [Maintenance
  subsystem](#contract-maintenance-subsystem) to recover contracts found in a
  recovery scan.


## Session Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [session.go](./session.go)
- [downloader.go](./downloader.go)
- [editor.go](./editor.go)

The Session subsystem provides an interface for communication with hosts. It
allows the contractor to modify its contracts through the renter-host protocol.
Sessions are used to initiate uploads, downloads, and file modifications. This
subsystem exports several methods used outside of the `Contractor` for this
purpose.

The session subsystem will watch out for certain host behaviors that indicate
the host is permanently unusable. If this happens, the session subsystem will
call 'MarkBadContract', which will prevent the contract from being considered a
part of the usable contracts, and allow the repair process to happen.

Pre-v1.4.0 contracts using an older version of the renter-host protocol use the
Editor and Downloader interfaces to interact with hosts.

### Pre-v1.4.0 Contract Modification

Modifications to file contracts are mediated through the Editor interface. An
Editor maintains a network connection to a host, over which is sends
modification requests, such as "delete sector 12." After each modification, the
Editor revises the underlying file contract and saves it to disk.

### Exports
The following `Session` methods are all exported by the Contractor:
- `Address`
- `Close`
- `ContractID`
- `Download`
- `DownloadIndex`
- `EndHeight`
- `Upload`
- `Replace`


## Persistence Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [persist.go](./persist.go)
- [persist\_journal.go](./persist_journal.go)


The Persistence subsystem is used to persist Contractor data across sessions.
Currently it uses the Uplo persist package. Prior to v1.3.0 the persistence
subsystem used a journal system which is no longer used. If, on startup, this
old journal system is found, the Contractor will convert it into the new
Persistence subsystem.

### Inbound Complexities
- `save` is called from the [Allowance](#allowance-subsystem), and
  [Maintenance](#contract-maintenance-subsystem) subsystems to persist the
  `Contractor` when its internal state is updated.

### Outbound Complexities
The persist system is also responsible for persisting the [Watchdog
subsystem](#watchdog-subsystem).


## Watchdog Subsystem
**Key Files**
- [watchdog.go](./watchdog.go)
- [watchdog\_persist.go](./watchdog\_persist.go)

The watchdog is responsible for monitoring the blockchain for file contracts,
revisions, and storage proofs that are relevant to the contractor.

To scan for revisions, the watchdog is used during the Contractor's
`ProcessConsensusChange` method and during the recovery subsystem's
`ProcessConsensusChange` method. 

When processing a newly added block the watchdog checks if any contracts,
revision, or storage proofs for a monitored contract have appeared on-chain. For
file contracts being monitored that haven't yet appeared on-chain, the watchdog
also monitors all the parent Uplocoin outputs used in the creation of the
contract. It will update the dependency set of that contract as blocks are added
and reverted. If a contract's inputs are ever double-spent, the  watchdog
notifies the Contractor. The Contractor returns the contract's funds to the
allowance, and marks the contract as `!GoodForUpload` and `!GoodForRenew`,

The watchdog will also check if any monitored contracts revisions or storage
proofs were removed in a reverted blocks and marks them as such. Note that once
a the storage proof window for a file contract elapses for the first time, the
watchdog will no longer monitor that contract. This is acceptable because even
if the storage proof is reorged out, the host has at least proven they fulfilled
their storage obligation once. It is up to the host to re-post storage proofs
if they are reorged out, if they want to claim valid proof outputs afterwards.

When the watchdog is synced to the `consensusset` it will do all of its checks
on monitored contracts in `managedCheckContracts`. It waits until being synced,
rather than taking action in the middle of a `ProcessConsensusChange` call to
avoid taking actions that would be prevented if e.g. the next block in a
`ConsensusChange` was checked. For example, a formation transaction may be
reverted and re-applied in the same consensus change. In this case, the watchdog
should not take any actions.

The watchdog does the following checks on monitored contracts.
- check that monitored file contract formation transaction sets appeared
  on-chain in the expected number of blocks. 
- re-send the transaction set if not, and double-spend the inputs used with the
  set if much more time has elapsed.
- check if any monitored contracts should have a more recent revision on-chain
  already. If not, the watchdog will send the latest revision transaction out.
- Check if storage proofs for a contract were found at the end of the expiration
  window

## Inbound Complexities
- `threadedSendMostRecentRevision` is called in a go-routine from the Contract
  Maintenance subsystem when a contract is renewed and no new revisions are
  expected.
- `callMonitorContract` is called from the Contract Maintenance and Recovery
  subsystems whenever contracts are formed, renewed, or recovered.
- `callScanConsensusChange`is used in the `ProcessConsensusChange` method of the
  contractor to let the watchdog scan blocks.
- `callPersistData` is called whenever the contractor's `persistData` is
  called.

## Outbound Complexities
- `callNotifyDoubleSpend` is a Contract Maintenance call used by the watchdog to
  indicate that a contract is double-spent and triggers actions from the
  Contractor.

## State Complexities
All state updates from the watchdog are driven by changes observed in
`ProcessConsensusChange` and from contract formation and renewal which cause a
file contract to be monitored. Therefore, the watchdog persist needs to be
synced with the most recent consensus change.

## Why The Watchdog Should Sweep Renter Inputs

If the watchdog fails to find a monitored file contract on-chain before its
`formationSweepHeight` the watchdog will sweep the inputs used by the renter to
create the file contract. This action must take place to prevent the renter from
overspending its allowance.

If the contractor were to simply create new contracts while other contracts were
still unconfirmed, it would be possible to overspend the set allowance. When the
watchdog sweeps its inputs successfully, the contract will be marked as
double-spent in which case the allowance funds are returned for further use.

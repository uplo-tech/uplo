// uploadchunkdistributionqueue.go creates a queue for distributing upload

// amount of throughput we will bump low priority work in to the priority work
// queue if too much priority work gets scheduled while the low priority work is
// waiting.

	// high priority traffic.

	// time uploads. A high rate means that users trying to upload new files
	// will often get stuck waiting for repair traffic that was bumped in
	// priority.

	// If the throughput is too low, repair traffic will have no priority and is
	// at risk of starving due to lots of new upload traffic. In general, the
	// best solution for handling high repair traffic is to migrate the current
	// node to a maintenance server (that is not receiving new uploads) and have
	// users upload to a fresh node that has very little need of repair traffic.

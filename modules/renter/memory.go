// memoryManager can handle requests for memory and returns of memory. The
// memory manager is initialized with a base amount of memory and it will allow
// up to that much memory to be requested simultaneously. Beyond that, it will
// block on calls to 'managedGetMemory' until enough memory has been returned to
// allow the request. High priority memory will be unblocked first, otherwise
// memory will be unblocked in a FIFO.
//
// The memory manager will put aside 'priorityReserve' memory for high priority
// requests. Lower priority requests will not be able to use this memory. This
// allows high priority requests in low volume to experience zero wait time even
// if there are a high volume of low priority requests.
//
// If a request is made that exceeds the base memory, the memory manager will
// block until all memory is available, and then grant the request, blocking all
// future requests for memory until the memory is returned. This allows large
// requests to go through even if there is not enough base memory.
//
// The memoryManager keeps track of how much memory has been returned since the
// last manual call to runtime.GC(). After enough memory has been returned since
// the previous manual call, the memoryManager will run a manual call to
// runtime.GC() and follow that up with a call to debug.FreeOSMemory(). This has
// been shown in production to significantly reduce the amount of RES that uplod
// consumes, without a significant hit to performance.
//
// Note that if a large low priority request comes in, it is possible for that
// large request to block higher priority requests because the memory manager
// will prefer to keep the memory footprint as close as possible to the
// initialized size rather than continue to allow high priority requests to go
// through when more than all of the memory has been used up.
//
// Note that there is a limited starvation prevention mechanism in place. If a
// large number of high priority requests are coming through, at a small ratio
// the lower priority requests will be bumped in priority.

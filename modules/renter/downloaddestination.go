// Downloads can be written directly to a file, can be written to an http
// stream, or can be written to an in-memory buffer. The core download loop only
// has the concept of writing using WriteAt, and then calling Close when the
// download is complete.
//
// To support streaming and writing to memory buffers, the downloadDestination
// interface exists. It is used to map things like a []byte or an io.WriteCloser
// to a downloadDestination. This interface is implemented by:
//		+ os.File
//		+ downloadDestinationBuffer (an alias of a []byte)
//		+ downloadDestinationWriteCloser (created using an io.WriteCloser)
//
// There is also a helper function to convert an io.Writer to an io.WriteCloser,
// so that an io.Writer can be used to create a downloadDestinationWriteCloser
// as well.

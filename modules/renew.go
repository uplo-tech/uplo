// RenewBaseCosts is a helper to calculate the base costs for a renewed
// contract. The base costs consist of the initial storage cost and collateral
// associated with renewing a contract that already contains data.
// NOTE: The baseCollateral is computed using the maximum acceptable collateral
// to the host. Because of uplofund fees, a renter may decide to use less than
// the amount of collateral advertised by the host. If the renter would rather
// have lower collateral and pay fewer uplofund fees, they have the full freedom
// within the protocol to do that. It is strictly advantageous for the host.

# Uplo-Node-Scanner

The Uplo-Node-Scanner tries to learn the IP addresses of all nodes in the Uplo
network in order to get an accurate count of current active nodes.

## Overview

The Uplo-Node-Scanner uses a Uplo gateway to explore the Uplo peer-to-peer network.
It attempts to connect to as many Uplo nodes as possible, and uses the ShareNodes
RPC with Uplo nodes to learn the IP addresses of more nodes in the network.
ShareNodes returns only 10 randomly selected peers, so the node scanner uses
this RPC multiple times with each peer to learn more from each of them.

Starting with the set of bootstrap nodes, the node scanner uses multiple worker
goroutines to scan each IP address it learns about from the network. The main
goroutine makes sure addresses are not scanned more than once in each scan, and
also logs any error messages generated by a worker's scan. If a worker learned
of some new IP addresses, the main goroutine adds them to a work queue so that
workers can scan them during the run. 

## Stored Data

During each scan the scanner creates a log of all IP addresses it attempts to
connect to, the Unix timestamp from the time of the attempt, and any errors that
resulted from the either the connection attempt or ShareNodes RPC attempts. 

In addition to a log for each scan, the scanner also maintains a persistent set
of all nodes it has successfully connected to. After the first run (which starts
with the bootstrap nodes), all future runs start off the scan by filling the
queue with this persistent set. For each node in the persisted set, we also
store the first connection time, the last successful connection time, recent
uptime (number of seconds last node was last down or since first connection),
total uptime, and also uptime percentage.
 
If a node has not been connected to successfully in over 30 days, it will be
pruned from the set the next time a scan is started.

## Usage 
Running the `make utils` command will create and install the binary for you. The
command `make test-utils` (and `make test`) will run the tests for the node
scanner.  Then running `uplo-node-scanner` will create a UploNodeScanner directory
in the working directory which contains a directory for the `gateway` module use
for the scan, which can be used for debugging, a `persisted-node-set.json` and
  `persisted-node-set.json_temp`, and timestamped files for each scan
  `scan-07-12:15:41.json`.

Use the `-dir` flag to specify which directory to make the `UploNodeScanner`
directory in. The flag defaults to the current working directory.

Ex:
```
UploNodeScanner
  persisted-node-set.json
  persisted-node-set.json_temp
  scan-07-12:15:41.json
  scan-07-13:15:41.json
  ...
  gateway

## Implementation details 
There is 1 main goroutine, and 10 worker goroutines. The main routine starts the
workers and creates workAssignments which are sent down a channel. The workers
read from this channel to start scanning different IP addresses. When a scan is
completed (either successfully or because an error was encountered) each worker
sends a NodeScanResult back down a result channel. The worker then reads from
this channel, logging the result and any errors, and creating new work
assignments if new IP addresses were discovered.

The main goroutine also periodically (every 10 seconds) prints counters and
connection stats to standard output. These counters are also logged at the end
of each scan in the scan file.

Every minute the main goroutine also updates the persisted node set file with
any additions or changes from the current scan. It also does this one last time
at the end of the run.

The main goroutine finishes the scan when all work assignments have been
completed, and when the work queues are empty. To do this, it keeps track of the
total number of assignments created and the total number of worker results read
back. When these numbers are equal, and both the assignment and result channels
are empty, the main goroutine finishes the scan by writing the last changes to
the scan log and persisted node set files.

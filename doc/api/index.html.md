# Introduction

## Welcome to the Uplo Storage Platform API!
> Example GET curl call 

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/wallet/transactions?startheight=1&endheight=250"
```

> Example POST curl call with data

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:8480/wallet/Uplocoins"
```

> Example POST curl call without data or authentication

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -X POST "localhost:8480/gateway/connect/123.456.789.0:8481"
```

Uplo uses semantic versioning and is backwards compatible to version v1.0.0.

API calls return either JSON or no content. Success is indicated by 2xx HTTP
status codes, while errors are indicated by 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes. If an
endpoint does not specify its expected status code refer to [standard
responses](#Standard-Responses).

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not
guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used in
production.

**Notes:**

- Requests must set their User-Agent string to contain the substring
  "Uplo-Agent".
- By default, uplod listens on "localhost:8480". This can be changed using the
  `--api-addr` flag when running uplod.
- **Do not bind or expose the API to a non-loopback address unless you are aware
  of the possible dangers.**

## Documentation Standards

The following details the documentation standards for the API endpoints.

 - Endpoints should follow the structure of:
    - Parameters
    - Response
 - Each endpoint should have a corresponding curl example
   - For formatting there needs to be a newline between `> curl example` and the
     example
 - All non-standard responses should have a JSON Response example with units
   - For formatting there needs to be a newline between `> JSON Response
     Example` and the example
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all JSON response fields
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all query string parameters
 - Query String Parameters should be separated into **REQUIRED** and
   **OPTIONAL** sections
 - Detailed descriptions should be structured as "**field** | units"
   - For formatting there needs to be two spaces after the units so that the
     description is on a new line
 - All code blocks should specify `go` as the language for consistent formatting

Contributors should follow these standards when submitting updates to the API
documentation.  If you find API endpoints that do not adhere to these
documentation standards please let the Uplo team know by submitting an issue
[here](https://github.com/uplo-tech/uplo/issues)

# Standard Responses

## Success
The standard response indicating the request was successfully processed is HTTP
status code `204 No Content`. If the request was successfully processed and the
server responded with JSON the HTTP status code is `200 OK`. Specific endpoints
may specify other 2xx status codes on success.

## Error

```go
{
    "message": String

    // There may be additional fields depending on the specific error.
}
```

The standard error response indicating the request failed for any reason, is a
4xx or 5xx HTTP status code with an error JSON object describing the error.

### Module Not Loaded

A module that is not reachable due to not being loaded by uplod will return
the custom status code `490 ModuleNotLoaded`. This is only returned during
startup. Once the startup is complete and the module is still not available,
ModuleDisabled will be returned.

### Module Disabled

A module that is not reachable due to being disabled, will return the custom
status code `491 ModuleDisabled`.

# Authentication
> Example POST curl call with Authentication

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:8480/wallet/Uplocoins"
```

API authentication is enabled by default, using a password stored in a flat
file. The location of this file is:

 - Linux:   `$HOME/.uplo/apipassword`
 - MacOS:   `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Uplo/apipassword`
 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Uplo\apipassword`


Note that the file contains a trailing newline, which must be trimmed before
use.

Authentication is HTTP Basic Authentication as described in [RFC
2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), however, the username is the empty
string. The flag does not enforce authentication on all API endpoints. Only
endpoints that expose sensitive information or modify state require
authentication.

For example, if the API password is "foobar" the request header should include

`Authorization: Basic OmZvb2Jhcg==`

And for a curl call the following would be included

`--user "":<apipassword>`

Authentication can be disabled by passing the `--authenticate-api=false` flag to
uplod. You can change the password by modifying the password file, setting the
`UPLO_API_PASSWORD` environment variable, or passing the `--temp-password` flag
to uplod.

# Units

Unless otherwise noted, all parameters should be identified in their smallest
possible unit. For example, size should always be specified in bytes and
Uplocoins should always be specified in hastings. JSON values returned by the API
will also use the smallest possible unit, unless otherwise noted.

If a number is returned as a string in JSON, it should be treated as an
arbitrary-precision number (bignum), and it should be parsed with your
language's corresponding bignum library. Currency values are the most common
example where this is necessary.

# Environment Variables
There are a number of environment variables supported by uplod and uploc.

 - `UPLO_API_PASSWORD` is the environment variable that sets a custom API
   password if the default is not used
 - `UPLO_DATA_DIR` is the environment variable that tells uplod where to put the
   general uplo data, e.g. api password, configuration, logs, etc.
 - `uplod_DATA_DIR` is the environment variable that tells uplod where to put the
   uplod-specific data
 - `UPLO_WALLET_PASSWORD` is the environment variable that can be set to enable
   auto unlocking the wallet
 - `UPLO_EXCHANGE_RATE` is the environment variable that can be set (e.g. to
   "0.00018 mBTC") to extend the output of some uploc subcommands when displaying
   currency amounts

# Consensus

The consensus set manages everything related to consensus and keeps the
blockchain in sync with the rest of the network. The consensus set's API
endpoint returns information about the state of the blockchain.

## /consensus [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/consensus"
```

Returns information about the consensus set, such as the current block height.
Also returns the set of constants in use in the consensus code.

```

Streams a series of consensus changes, starting from the provided change ID.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**id** | string
The consensus change ID to subscribe from. There are two sentinel values:
to subscribe from the genesis block use:
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```
0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
In addition, each consensus change contains its own ID.

### Response

## /consensus/validate/transactionset [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" --data "[JSON-encoded-txnset]" "localhost:8480/validate/transactionset"
```

validates a set of transactions using the current utxo set.

### Request Body Bytes

Since transactions may be large, the transaction set is supplied in the POST
body, encoded in JSON format.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

# Daemon

The daemon is responsible for starting and stopping the modules which make up
the rest of Uplo.

## /daemon/alerts [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/daemon/alerts"
```

Returns all alerts of all severities of the Uplo instance sorted by severity from highest to lowest in `alerts` and the alerts of the Uplo instance sorted by category in `criticalalerts`, `erroralerts` and `warningalerts`.

      "module": "contractor",
      "severity": "warning",
    }
  ],
  "criticalalerts": [],
  "erroralerts": [],
  "warningalerts": [
    {
      "cause": "wallet is locked",

      "module": "contractor",
      "severity": "warning",
    }
  ]
}
```
**cause** | string  
Cause is the cause for the information contained in msg if known.

**msg** | string  
Msg contains information about an issue.

**module** | string  
Module is the module which caused the alert.

**severity** | string  
Severity is either "warning", "error" or "critical" where "error" might be a
lack of internet access and "critical" would be a lack of funds and contracts
that are about to expire due to that.

## /daemon/constants [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/daemon/constants"
```

Returns the some of the constants that the Uplo daemon uses.

BlockFrequency is the desired number of seconds that should elapse, on average,
between successive Blocks.

**blocksizelimit** | uint64  
BlockSizeLimit is the maximum size of a binary-encoded Block that is permitted
by the consensus rules.

**extremefuturethreshold** | timestamp  
ExtremeFutureThreshold is a temporal limit beyond which Blocks are discarded by
the consensus rules. When incoming Blocks are processed, their Timestamp is
allowed to exceed the processor's current time by a small amount. But if the
Timestamp is further into the future than ExtremeFutureThreshold, the Block is
immediately discarded.

**futurethreshold** | timestamp  
FutureThreshold is a temporal limit beyond which Blocks are discarded by the
consensus rules. When incoming Blocks are processed, their Timestamp is allowed
to exceed the processor's current time by no more than FutureThreshold. If the
excess duration is larger than FutureThreshold, but smaller than
ExtremeFutureThreshold, the Block may be held in memory until the Block's
Timestamp exceeds the current time by less than FutureThreshold.

**genesistimestamp** | timestamp  
GenesisBlock is the first block of the block chain

**maturitydelay** | blockheight  
MaturityDelay specifies the number of blocks that a maturity-required output is
required to be on hold before it can be spent on the blockchain. Outputs are
maturity-required if they are highly likely to be altered or invalidated in the
event of a small reorg. One example is the block reward, as a small reorg may
invalidate the block reward. Another example is a uplofund payout, as a tiny
reorg may change the value of the payout, and thus invalidate any transactions
spending the payout. File contract payouts also are subject to a maturity delay.

**mediantimestampwindow** | uint64  
MedianTimestampWindow tells us how many blocks to look back when calculating the
median timestamp over the previous n blocks. The timestamp of a block is not
allowed to be less than or equal to the median timestamp of the previous n
blocks, where for Uplo this number is typically 11.

**uplofundcount** | currency  
UplofundCount is the total number of Uplofunds in existence.

**uplofundportion** | big.Rat  
UplofundPortion is the percentage of Uplocoins that is taxed from FileContracts.

**targetwindow** | blockheight  
TargetWindow is the number of blocks to look backwards when determining how much
time has passed vs. how many blocks have been created. It's only used in the
old, broken difficulty adjustment algorithm.

**initialcoinbase** | uint64  
InitialCoinbase is the coinbase reward of the Genesis block.

**minimumcoinbase** | uint64  
MinimumCoinbase is the minimum coinbase reward for a block. The coinbase
decreases in each block after the Genesis block, but it will not decrease past
MinimumCoinbase.

**roottarget** | target  
RootTarget is the target for the genesis block - basically how much work needs
to be done in order to mine the first block. The difficulty adjustment algorithm
takes over from there.

**rootdepth** | target  
RootDepth is the cumulative target of all blocks. The root depth is essentially
the maximum possible target, there have been no blocks yet, so there is no
cumulated difficulty yet.

**defaultallowance** | allowance  
DefaultAllowance is the set of default allowance settings that will be used when
allowances are not set or not fully set. See [/renter GET](#renter-get) for an
explanation of the fields.

**maxtargetadjustmentup** | big.Rat  
MaxTargetAdjustmentUp restrict how much the block difficulty is allowed to
change in a single step, which is important to limit the effect of difficulty
raising and lowering attacks.

**maxtargetadjustmentdown** | big.Rat  
MaxTargetAdjustmentDown restrict how much the block difficulty is allowed to
change in a single step, which is important to limit the effect of difficulty
raising and lowering attacks.

**Uplocoinprecision** | currency  
UplocoinPrecision is the number of base units in a Uplocoin. The Uplo network has a
very large number of base units. We call 10^24 of these a Uplocoin.

```
**externalsettings**    
The settings that get displayed to untrusted nodes querying the host's status.  
  
**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
Whether or not the host is accepting new contracts.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download
request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger
batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the
renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.


**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration that a host will allow for a file contract. The host
commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a
large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The
storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current
height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can
perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to
provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by
limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there
is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.


**netaddress** | string  
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted
at.  

**remainingstorage** | bytes  
The amount of unused storage capacity on the host in bytes. It should be noted
that the host can lie.  

**sectorsize** | bytes  
The smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded when
performing calls to the host.  

**totalstorage** | bytes  
The total amount of storage capacity on the host. It should be noted that the
host can lie.  

**unlockhash** | hash  
The unlock hash is the address at which the host can be paid when forming file
contracts.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a
storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window
that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage
that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file
contract.  

**contractprice** | hastings  
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The
payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and
the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.  

**uploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**registrysize** | int  
The size of the registry in bytes. One entry requires 256 bytes of storage on
disk and the size of the registry needs to be a multiple of 64 entries.
Therefore any provided number >0 bytes will be rounded to the nearest 16kib.
The default is 0 which means no registry.

**customregistrypath** | string  
The path of the registry on disk. If it's empty, it uses the default location
relative to uplod's host folder. Otherwise the provided path will be used.
Changing it will trigger a registry migration which takes an arbitrary amount
of time depending on the size of the registry.

**revisionnumber** | int  
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host
is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple
conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with
the higher revision number to be more recent.  

**version** | string  
The version of external settings being used. This field helps coordinate updates
while preserving compatibility with older nodes.  

**financialmetrics**    
The financial status of the host.  
  
**contractcount** | int  
Number of open file contracts.  

**contractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file
contracts. The host is required to submit a file contract revision and a storage
proof for every file contract that gets created, and the renter pays for the
miner fees on  these objects.  

**potentialcontractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file
contracts which have not been confirmed yet. The potential compensation becomes
compensation after the storage proof is submitted.  

**lockedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of storage collateral which the host has tied up in file contracts.
The host has to commit collateral to a file contract even if there is no
storage, but the locked collateral will be returned even if the host does not
submit a storage proof - the collateral is not at risk, it is merely set aside
so that it can be put at risk later.  

**lostrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue, including storage revenue and bandwidth revenue, that has
been lost due to failed file contracts and failed storage proofs.  

**loststoragecollateral** | hastings

to failed file contracts and missed storage proofs.  

**potentialstoragerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue that the host stands to earn if all storage proofs are
submitted correctly and in time.

**riskedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has risked on file contracts. If the host
starts missing storage proofs, the host can forfeit up to this many coins. In
the event of a missed storage proof, locked storage collateral gets returned,
but risked storage collateral does not get returned.  

**storagerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has earned from storing data. This money has
been locked down by successful storage proofs.  

**transactionfeeexpenses** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has spent on transaction fees when submitting
host announcements, file contract revisions, and storage proofs.  

**downloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters downloading their files.
This money has been locked in by successsful storage proofs.  

**potentialdownloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that downloaded
their files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully
submits storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**potentialuploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that uploaded
files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully submits
storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**uploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters uploading their files.
This money has been locked in by successful storage proofs.  

**internalsettings**    
The settings of the host. Most interactions between the user and the host occur
by changing the internal settings.  

**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
When set to true, the host will accept new file contracts if the terms are
reasonable. When set to false, the host will not accept new file contracts at
all.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download
request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger
batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the
renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.


**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration of a file contract that the host will accept. The storage
proof window must end before the current height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can
perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to
provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by
limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there
is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.


**netaddress** | string  
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted
at. If left blank, the host will automatically figure out its ip address and use
that. If given, the host will use the address given.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a
storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window
that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral per byte per
block of storage that is contracted by the renter.  

**collateralbudget** | hastings  
The total amount of money that the host will allocate to collateral across all
file contracts.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file
contract.

**minbaserpcprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter for interacting with
the host. This is charged for every interaction a renter has with a host to pay
for resources consumed during the interaction. It is added to the
`mindownloadbandwidthprice` and `minuploadbandwidthprice` when uploading or
downloading files from the host.

**mincontractprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when forming a
contract. Typically this price is to cover transaction fees on the file contract
revision and storage proof, but can also be used if the host has a low amount of
collateral. The price is a minimum because the host may automatically adjust the
price upwards in times of high demand.  

**mindownloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is
downloading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from
the minimum.

**minsectoraccessprice** | hastings  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter for accessing a sector
of data on disk. Since the host has to read at least a full 4MB sector from disk
regardless of how much the renter intends to download this is charged to pay for
the physical disk resources the host uses. It is multiplied by the number of
sectors read then added to the `mindownloadbandwidthprice` when downloading a
file.

**minstorageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The minimum price that the host will demand when storing data for extended
periods of time. If the host is low on space, the price of storage may be set
higher than the minimum.  

**minuploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is
uploading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from
the minimum.  

**ephemeralaccountexpiry** | seconds  
The  maximum amount of time an ephemeral account can be inactive before it is
considered to be expired and gets deleted. After an account has expired, the
account owner has no way of retrieving the funds. Setting this value to 0 means
ephemeral accounts never expire, regardless of how long they have been inactive.

**maxephemeralaccountbalance** | hastings  
The maximum amount of money that the host will allow a user to deposit into a
single ephemeral account.

**maxephemeralaccountrisk** | hastings  
To increase performance, the host will allow a user to withdraw from an
ephemeral account without requiring the user to wait until the host has
persisted the updated ephemeral account balance to complete a transaction. This
means that the user can perform actions such as downloads with significantly
less latency. This also means that if the host loses power at that exact moment,
the host will forget that the user has spent money and the user will be able to
spend that money again.

maxephemeralaccountrisk is the maximum amount of money that the host is willing
to risk to a system failure. The account manager will keep track of the total
amount of money that has been withdrawn, but has not yet been persisted to disk.
If a user's withdrawal would put the host over the maxephemeralaccountrisk, the
host will wait to complete the user's transaction until it has persisted the
widthdrawal, to prevent the host from having too much money at risk.

Note that money is only at risk if the host experiences an unclean shutdown
while in the middle of a transaction with a user, and generally the amount at
risk will be minuscule unless the host experiences an unclean shutdown while in
the middle of many transactions with many users at once. This value should be
larger than maxephemeralaccountbalance but does not need to be significantly
larger.

**networkmetrics**    
Information about the network, specifically various ways in which renters have
contacted the host.  

**downloadcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has attempted to download something from the
host.  

**errorcalls** | int  
The number of calls that have resulted in errors. A small number of errors are
expected, but a large number of errors indicate either buggy software or
malicious network activity. Usually buggy software.  

**formcontractcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has tried to form a contract with the host.  

**renewcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has tried to renew a contract with the host.  

**revisecalls** | int  
The number of times that the renter has tried to revise a contract with the
host.  

**settingscalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has queried the host for the host's settings.
The settings include the price of bandwidth, which is a price that can adjust
every few minutes. This value is usually very high compared to the others.  

**unrecognizedcalls** | int  
The number of times that a renter has attempted to use an unrecognized call.
Larger numbers typically indicate buggy software.  

**connectabilitystatus** | string  
connectabilitystatus is one of "checking", "connectable", or "not connectable",
and indicates if the host can connect to itself on its configured NetAddress.  

**workingstatus** | string

The minimum price that the host will demand from a renter when the renter is
uploading data. If the host is saturated, the host may increase the price from
the minimum.  

**maxephemeralaccountbalance** | hastings  
The maximum amount of money that the host will allow a user to deposit into a
single ephemeral account.

**maxephemeralaccountrisk** | hastings  
To increase performance, the host will allow a user to withdraw from an
ephemeral account without requiring the user to wait until the host has
persisted the updated ephemeral account balance to complete a transaction. This
means that the user can perform actions such as downloads with significantly
less latency. This also means that if the host loses power at that exact moment,
the host will forget that the user has spent money and the user will be able to
spend that money again.

maxephemeralaccountrisk is the maximum amount of money that the host is willing
to risk to a system failure. The account manager will keep track of the total
amount of money that has been withdrawn, but has not yet been persisted to disk.
If a user's withdrawal would put the host over the maxephemeralaccountrisk, the
host will wait to complete the user's transaction until it has persisted the
widthdrawal, to prevent the host from having too much money at risk.

Note that money is only at risk if the host experiences an
unclean shutdown while in the middle of a transaction with a user, and generally
the amount at risk will be minuscule unless the host experiences an unclean
shutdown while in the middle of many transactions with many users at once. This
value should be larger than 'maxephemeralaccountbalance but does not need to be
significantly larger.

**registrysize** | int  
The size of the registry in bytes. One entry requires 256 bytes of storage on
disk and the size of the registry needs to be a multiple of 64 entries.
Therefore any provided number >0 bytes will be rounded to the nearest 16kib.
The default is 0 which means no registry.

**customregistrypath** | string  
The path of the registry on disk. If it's empty, it uses the default location
relative to uplod's host folder. Otherwise the provided path will be used.
Changing it will trigger a registry migration which takes an arbitrary amount
of time depending on the size of the registry.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

}
```
**path** | string  
Absolute path to the storage folder on the local filesystem.  

**capacity** | bytes  
Maximum capacity of the storage folder in bytes. The host will not store more
than this many bytes in the folder. This capacity is not checked against the

sufficient capacity for the folder at all times. Otherwise you risk losing
renter's data and failing storage proofs.  

**capacityremaining** | bytes  
Unused capacity of the storage folder in bytes.  

**failedreads, failedwrites** | int  
Number of failed disk read & write operations. A large number of failed reads or
writes indicates a problem with the filesystem or drive's hardware.

## /host/storage/folders/add [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&size=1000000000000" "localhost:8480/host/storage/folders/add"
```

adds a storage folder to the manager. The manager may not check that there is
enough space available on-disk to support as much storage as requested

### Storage Folder Limits
A host can only have 65536 storage folders in total which have to be between 256
MiB and 16 PiB in size

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to add.  

**size** | bytes  
Initial capacity of the storage folder. This value isn't validated so it is
possible to set the capacity of the storage folder greater than the capacity of
the disk. Do not do this.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/remove [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&force=false" "localhost:8480/host/storage/folders/remove"
```

Remove a storage folder from the manager. All storage on the folder will be
moved to other stoarge folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the
manager is unable to save data, an error will be returned and the operation will
be stopped.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to removed.  

### OPTIONAL
**force** | boolean  
If `force` is true, the storage folder will be removed even if the data in the
storage folder cannot be moved to other storage folders, typically because they
don't have sufficient capacity. If `force` is true and the data cannot be moved,
data will be lost.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/resize [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&newsize=1000000000000" "localhost:8480/host/storage/folders/resize"
```

Grows or shrinks a storage file in the manager. The manager may not check that
there is enough space on-disk to support growing the storasge folder, but should
gracefully handle running out of space unexpectedly. When shrinking a storage
folder, any data in the folder that needs to be moved will be placed into other
storage folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the manager is unable to
migrate the data, an error will be returned and the operation will be stopped.

### Storage Folder Limits
See [/host/storage/folders/add](#host-storage-folders-add-post)

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to resize.  

**newsize** | bytes  
Desired new size of the storage folder. This will be the new capacity of the
storage folder.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/sectors/delete/:*merkleroot* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:8480/host/storage/sectors/delete/[merkleroot]"
```

Deletes a sector, meaning that the manager will be unable to upload that sector
and be unable to provide a storage proof on that sector. This endpoint is for
removing the data entirely, and will remove instances of the sector appearing at
all heights. The primary purpose is to comply with legal requests to remove
data.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**merkleroot** | merkleroot  
Merkleroot of the sector to delete.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum number of bytes that the host will allow to be requested by a single
download request.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
Maximum duration in blocks that a host will allow for a file contract. The host
commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a
large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The
storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current
height + maxduration.  

There is a block approximately every 10 minutes. e.g. 1 day = 144 blocks  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum size in bytes of a single batch of file contract revisions. Larger batch
sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead
associated with performing a batch upload.  

**netaddress** | string  
Remote address of the host. It can be an IPv4, IPv6, or hostname, along with the
port. IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets.

The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage
that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file
contract.

the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.

The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**revisionnumber** | int  
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host
is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple
conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with
the higher revision number to be more recent.  

**version** | string  
The version of the host.  

**firstseen** | blocks  
Firstseen is the last block height at which this host was announced.  

**historicdowntime** | nanoseconds  
Total amount of time the host has been offline.

**recentsuccessfulinteractions** | int  
Number of recent successful interactions with the host.  

**lasthistoricupdate** | blocks  
The last time that the interactions within scanhistory have been compressed into
the historic ones.  

**ipnets**  
List of IP subnet masks used by the host. For IPv4 the /24 and for IPv6 the /54
subnet mask is used. A host can have either one IPv4 or one IPv6 subnet or one
of each. E.g. these lists are valid: [ "IPv4" ], [ "IPv6" ] or [ "IPv4", "IPv6"
]. The following lists are invalid: [ "IPv4", "IPv4" ], [ "IPv4", "IPv6", "IPv6"
]. Hosts with an invalid list are ignored.  

**lastipnetchange** | date

Indicates if the host is currently being filtered from the HostDB

## /hostdb/all [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/hostdb/all"
```

Lists all of the hosts known to the renter. Hosts are not guaranteed to be in
any particular order, and the order may change in subsequent calls.

### JSON Response 
Response is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts)

## /hostdb/hosts/:*pubkey* [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/hostdb/hosts/ed25519:8a95848bc71e9689e2f753c82c35dc47a1d62867f77c0113ebb6fa5b51723215"
```

fetches detailed information about a particular host, including metrics
regarding the score of the host within the database. It should be noted that
each renter uses different metrics for selecting hosts, and that a good score on
in one hostdb does not mean that the host will be successful on the network
overall.

### Path Parameters
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/hostdb/hosts/<pubkey>"
```
### REQUIRED
**pubkey**  
The public key of the host. Each public key identifies a single host.  

Example Pubkey:
ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef

  }
}
```
Response is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts) with the additional of the
**scorebreakdown**

**scorebreakdown**  
A set of scores as determined by the renter. Generally, the host's final score
is all of the values multiplied together. Modified renters may have additional
criteria that they use to judge a host, or may ignore certin criteia. In
general, these fields should only be used as a loose guide for the score of a
host, as every renter sees the world differently and uses different metrics to
evaluate hosts.  

**score** | big int  
The overall score for the host. Scores are entriely relative, and are consistent
only within the current hostdb. Between different machines, different
configurations, and different versions the absolute scores for a given host can
be off by many orders of magnitude. When displaying to a human, some form of
normalization with respect to the other hosts (for example, divide all scores by
the median score of the hosts) is recommended.  

**acceptcontractadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on whether its accepting contracts or not. Typically "1" if they do and "0" if they don't.

**ageadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how long it has been a
host. Older hosts typically have a lower penalty.  

**basepriceadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on if the `BaseRPCPRice` and
the `SectorAccessPrice` are reasonable.  

**burnadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how much proof-of-burn the
host has performed. More burn causes a linear increase in score.  

**collateraladjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much collateral the host
is offering. More collateral is typically better, though above a point it can be
detrimental.  

**conversionrate** | float64  
conversionrate is the likelihood that the host will be selected by renters
forming contracts.  

**durationadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the max duration it accepts
for file contracts. Typically '1' for hosts with an acceptable max duration, and
'0' for hosts that have a max duration which is not long enough.

**interactionadjustment** | float64  
The multipler that gets applied to a host based on previous interactions with
the host. A high ratio of successful interactions will improve this hosts score,
and a high ratio of failed interactions will hurt this hosts score. This
adjustment helps account for hosts that are on unstable connections, don't keep
their wallets unlocked, ran out of funds, etc.  

**pricesmultiplier** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the host's price. Lower
prices are almost always better. Below a certain, very low price, there is no
advantage.  

**storageremainingadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much storage is
remaining for the host. More storage remaining is better, to a point.  

**uptimeadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the uptime percentage of the
host. The penalty increases extremely quickly as uptime drops below 90%.  

**versionadjustment** | float64  
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the version of Uplo that they
are running. Versions get penalties if there are known bugs, scaling
limitations, performance limitations, etc. Generally, the most recent version is
always the one with the highest score.  

## /hostdb/filtermode [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/hostdb/filtermode"
```  
Returns the current filter mode of the hostDB and any filtered hosts.

### JSON Response 
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "filtermode": "blacklist",  // string
  "hosts":
    [
      "ed25519:122218260fb74b20a8be3000ad56a931f7461ea990a6dc5676c31bdf65fc668f"  // string
    ]
}

```
**filtermode** | string  
Can be either whitelist, blacklist, or disable.  

**hosts** | array of strings  
Comma separated pubkeys.  

## /hostdb/filtermode [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data '{"filtermode" : "whitelist","hosts" : ["ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef","ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef","ed25519:1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"]}' "localhost:8480/hostdb/filtermode"
```  
```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data '{"filtermode" : "disable"}' "localhost:8480/hostdb/filtermode"
```
Lets you enable and disable a filter mode for the hostdb. Currently the two
modes supported are `blacklist` mode and `whitelist` mode. In `blacklist` mode,
any hosts you identify as being on the `blacklist` will not be used to form
contracts. In `whitelist` mode, only the hosts identified as being on the
`whitelist` will be used to form contracts. In both modes, hosts that you are
blacklisted will be filtered from your hostdb. To enable either mode, set
`filtermode` to the desired mode and submit a list of host pubkeys as the
corresponding `blacklist` or `whitelist`. To disable either list, the `host`
field can be left blank (e.g. empty slice) and the `filtermode` should be set to
`disable`.  

**NOTE:** Enabling and disabling a filter mode can result in changes with your
current contracts with can result in an increase in contract fee spending. For
example, if `blacklist` mode is enabled, any hosts that you currently have
contracts with that are also on the provide list of `hosts` will have their
contracts replaced with non-blacklisted hosts. When `whitelist` mode is enabled,
contracts will be replaced until there are only contracts with whitelisted
hosts. Even disabling a filter mode can result in a change in contracts if there
are better scoring hosts in your hostdb that were previously being filtered out.


### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**filtermode** | string  
Can be either whitelist, blacklist, or disable.  

**hosts** | array of string  
Comma separated pubkeys.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

# Miner

The miner provides endpoints for getting headers for work and submitting solved
headers to the network. The miner also provides endpoints for controlling a
basic CPU mining implementation.

## /miner [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/miner"
```
returns the status of the miner.

### JSON Response 
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "blocksmined":      9001,   // int
  "cpuhashrate":      1337,   // hashes / second
  "cpumining":        false,  // boolean
  "staleblocksmined": 0,      // int
}
```
**blocksmined** | int  
Number of mined blocks. This value is remembered after restarting.  

**cpuhashrate** | hashes / second  
How fast the cpu is hashing, in hashes per second.  

**cpumining** | boolean  
true if the cpu miner is active.  

**staleblocksmined** | int  
Number of mined blocks that are stale, indicating that they are not included in
the current longest chain, likely because some other block at the same height
had its chain extended first.  


## /miner/start [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/miner/start"
```

Starts a single threaded CPU miner. Does nothing if the CPU miner is already
running.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /miner/stop [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/miner/stop"
```

stops the cpu miner. Does nothing if the cpu miner is not running.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /miner/block [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -data "<byte-encoded-block>" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/miner/block"
```

Submits a solved block and broadcasts it.

### Byte Request

For efficiency the block is submitted in a raw byte encoding using the Uplo
encoding.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).


## /miner/header [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/miner/header"
```

provides a block header that is ready to be grinded on for work.

### Byte Response
For efficiency the header for work is returned as a raw byte encoding of the
header, rather than encoded to JSON.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the
header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with
that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64
possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call
/miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle
root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash
of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan
block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the
Uplo Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is
the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs
(one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction).
Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within response | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

## /miner/header [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -data "<byte-encoded-header>" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/miner"
```

submits a header that has passed the POW.

### Byte Request
For efficiency headers are submitted as raw byte encodings of the header in the
body of the request, rather than as a query string parameter or path parameter.
The request body should contain only the 80 bytes of the encoded header. The
encoding is the same encoding used in `/miner/header [GET]` endpoint.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the
header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with
that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64
possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call
/miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle
root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash
of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan
block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the
Uplo Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is
the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs
(one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction).
Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within request | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

# Renter

The renter manages the user's files on the network. The renter's API endpoints
expose methods for managing files on the network and managing the renter's
allocated funds.

## /renter [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/renter"
```

Returns the current settings along with metrics on the renter's spending.

**settings**    
Settings that control the behavior of the renter.  

**allowance**   
Allowance dictates how much the renter is allowed to spend in a given period.
Note that funds are spent on both storage and bandwidth.  

**funds** | hastings  
Funds determines the number of Uplocoins that the renter will spend when forming
contracts with hosts. The renter will not allocate more than this amount of
Uplocoins into the set of contracts each billing period. If the renter spends all
of the funds but then needs to form new contracts, the renter will wait until
either until the user increase the allowance funds, or until a new billing
period is reached. If there are not enough funds to repair all files, then files
may be at risk of getting lost.

**hosts** | int  
Hosts sets the number of hosts that will be used to form the allowance. Uplo
gains most of its resiliancy from having a large number of hosts. More hosts
will mean both more robustness and higher speeds when using the network, however
will also result in more memory consumption and higher blockchain fees. It is
recommended that the default number of hosts be treated as a minimum, and that
double the default number of default hosts be treated as a maximum.

**period** | blocks  
The period is equivalent to the billing cycle length. The renter will not spend
more than the full balance of its funds every billing period. When the billing
period is over, the contracts will be renewed and the spending will be reset.

**renewwindow** | blocks  
The renew window is how long the user has to renew their contracts. At the end
of the period, all of the contracts expire. The contracts need to be renewed
before they expire, otherwise the user will lose all of their files. The renew
window is the window of time at the end of the period during which the renter
will renew the users contracts. For example, if the renew window is 1 week long,
then during the final week of each period the user will renew their contracts.
If the user is offline for that whole week, the user's data will be lost.

Each billing period begins at the beginning of the renew window for the previous
period. For example, if the period is 12 weeks long and the renew window is 4
weeks long, then the first billing period technically begins at -4 weeks, or 4
weeks before the allowance is created. And the second billing period begins at
week 8, or 8 weeks after the allowance is created. The third billing period will
begin at week 20.

**expectedstorage** | bytes  
Expected storage is the amount of storage that the user expects to keep on the
Uplo network. This value is important to calibrate the spending habits of uplod.
Because Uplo is decentralized, there is no easy way for uplod to know what the
real world cost of storage is, nor what the real world price of a Uplocoin is. To
overcome this deficiency, uplod depends on the user for guidance.

If the user has a low allowance and a high amount of expected storage, uplod will
more heavily prioritize cheaper hosts, and will also be more comfortable with
hosts that post lower amounts of collateral. If the user has a high allowance
and a low amount of expected storage, uplod will prioritize hosts that post more
collateral, as well as giving preference to hosts better overall traits such as
uptime and age.

Even when the user has a large allowance and a low amount of expected storage,
uplod will try to optimize for saving money; uplod tries to meet the users storage
and bandwidth needs while spending significantly less than the overall
allowance.

**expectedupload** | bytes  
Expected upload tells uplod how many bytes per block the user expects to upload
during the configured period. If this value is high, uplod will more strongly
prefer hosts that have a low upload bandwidth price. If this value is low, uplod
will focus on metrics other than upload bandwidth pricing, because even if the
host charges a lot for upload bandwidth, it will not impact the total cost to
the user very much.

The user should not consider upload bandwidth used during repairs, uplod will
consider repair bandwidth separately.

**expecteddownload** | bytes  
Expected download tells uplod how many bytes per block the user expects to
download during the configured period. If this value is high, uplod will more
strongly prefer hosts that have a low download bandwidth price. If this value is
low, uplod will focus on metrics other than download bandwidth pricing, because
even if the host charges a lot for downloads, it will not impact the total cost
to the user very much.

The user should not consider download bandwidth used during repairs, uplod will
consider repair bandwidth separately.

**expectedredundancy** | bytes  
Expected redundancy is used in conjunction with expected storage to determine
the total amount of raw storage that will be stored on hosts. If the expected
storage is 1 TB and the expected redundancy is 3, then the renter will calculate
that the total amount of storage in the user's contracts will be 3 TiB.

This value does not need to be changed from the default unless the user is
manually choosing redundancy settings for their file. If different files are
being given different redundancy settings, then the average of all the
redundancies should be used as the value for expected redundancy, weighted by
how large the files are.

**maxuploadspeed** | bytes per second  
MaxUploadSpeed by default is unlimited but can be set by the user to manage
bandwidth.  

**maxdownloadspeed** | bytes per second  
MaxDownloadSpeed by default is unlimited but can be set by the user to manage
bandwidth.  

**streamcachesize** | int  
The StreamCacheSize is the number of data chunks that will be cached during
streaming.  

**financialmetrics**    
Metrics about how much the Renter has spent on storage, uploads, and downloads.


**contractfees** | hastings  
Amount of money spent on contract fees, transaction fees and uplofund fees.  

**contractspending** | hastings, (deprecated, now totalallocated)  
How much money, in hastings, the Renter has spent on file contracts, including
fees.  

**downloadspending** | hastings  
Amount of money spent on downloads.  

**storagespending** | hastings  
Amount of money spend on storage.  

**totalallocated** | hastings  
Total amount of money that the renter has put into contracts. Includes spent
money and also money that will be returned to the renter.  

**uploadspending** | hastings  
Amount of money spent on uploads.  

**unspent** | hastings  
Amount of money in the allowance that has not been spent.  

**currentperiod** | blockheight  
Height at which the current allowance period began.  

**nextperiod** | blockheight  
Height at which the next allowance period began.  

**uploadsstatus**  
Information about the renter's uploads.  

**paused** | boolean  
Indicates whether or not the uploads and repairs are paused.  

**pauseendtime** | unix timestamp  
The time at which the pause will end.  

## /renter [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "period=12096&renewwindow=4032&funds=1000&hosts=50" "localhost:8480/renter"
```

Modify settings that control the renter's behavior.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
When setting the allowance the Funds and Period are required. Since these are
the two required fields, the allowance can be canceled by submitting the zero
values for these fields.

### OPTIONAL
Any of the renter settings can be set, see fields [here](#settings)

**checkforipviolation** | boolean  
Enables or disables the check for hosts using the same ip subnets within the
hostdb. It's turned on by default and causes Uplo to not form contracts with
hosts from the same subnet and if such contracts already exist, it will
deactivate the contract which has occupied that subnet for the shorter time.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/allowance/cancel [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword>  "localhost:8480/renter/allowance/cancel"
```

Cancel the Renter's allowance.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/clean [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword>  "localhost:8480/renter/clean"
```

clears any lost files from the renter. A lost file is a file that is viewed as
unrecoverable. A file is unrecoverable when there is not a local copy on disk
and the file's redundancy is less than 1. This means the file can not be
repaired.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/contract/cancel [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "id=bd7ef21b13fb85eda933a9ff2874ec50a1ffb4299e98210bf0dd343ae1632f80" "localhost:8480/renter/contract/cancel"
```

cancels a specific contract of the Renter.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**id** | hash  
ID of the file contract

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/backup [POST]
> curl example

curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "destination=/home/backups/01-01-1968.backup" "localhost:8480/renter/backup"
```

Creates a backup of all uplofiles in the renter at the specified path.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**destination** | string  
The path on disk where the backup will be created. Needs to be an absolute path.

### OPTIONAL
**remote** | boolean

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/recoverbackup [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "source=/home/backups/01-01-1968.backup" "localhost:8480/renter/recoverbackup"
```

Recovers an existing backup from the specified path by adding all the uplofiles
contained within it to the renter. Should a uplofile for a certain path already
exist, a number will be added as a suffix. e.g. 'myfile_1.uplo'

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**source** | string  
The path on disk where the backup will be recovered from. Needs to be an
absolute path.

### OPTIONAL
**remote** | boolean  
flag indicating if the backup is stored on hosts. If true, **source** is
interpreted as the backup's name, not its path.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/contracts [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/renter/contracts?disabled=true&expired=true&recoverable=false"
```

Returns the renter's contracts. Active, passive, and refreshed contracts are
returned by default. Active contracts are contracts that the Renter is currently
using to store, upload, and download data. Passive contracts are contracts that
are no longer GoodForUpload but are GoodForRenew. This means the data will
continue to be available to be downloaded from. Refreshed contracts are
contracts that ran out of funds and needed to be renewed so more money could be
added to the contract with the host. The data reported in these contracts is
duplicate data and should not be included in any accounting. Disabled contracts
are contracts that are in the current period and have not yet expired that are
not being used for uploading as they were replaced instead of renewed. Expired
contracts are contracts with an `EndHeight` in the past, where no more data is
being stored and excess funds have been released to the renter. Expired
Refreshed contracts are contracts that were refreshed at some point in a
previous period. The data reported in these contracts is duplicate data and
should not be included in any accounting. Recoverable contracts are contracts
which the contractor is currently trying to recover and which haven't expired
yet.

| Type              | GoodForUpload | GoodForRenew | Endheight in the Future | Data Counted Elsewhere Already|
| ----------------- | :-----------: | :----------: | :---------------------: | :---------------------------: |

| Passive           | No            | Yes          | Yes                     | No                            |
| Refreshed         | No            | No           | Yes                     | Yes                           |
| Disabled          | No            | No           | Yes                     | No                            |
| Expired           | No            | No           | No                      | No                            |
| Expired Refreshed | No            | No           | No                      | Yes                           |

**NOTE:** No spending is double counted anywhere in the contracts, only the data
is double counted in the refreshed contracts. For spending totals in the current
period, all spending in active, passive, refreshed, and disabled contracts
should be counted. For data totals, the data in active and passive contracts is
the total uploaded while the data in disabled contracts is wasted uploaded data.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**disabled** | boolean  
flag indicating if disabled contracts should be returned.

**expired** | boolean  
flag indicating if expired contracts should be returned.

```

**directories**\
An array of uplo directories. Directories contain directory level metadata and
aggregate metadata for the subtree of the filesystem of which the directory
is the root of.

**aggregatehealth** | **health** | float64\
This is the worst health of any of the files or subdirectories. Health is the
percent of parity pieces missing.
 - health = 0 is full redundancy
 - health <= 1 is recoverable
 - health > 1 needs to be repaired from disk

**aggregatelasthealthchecktime** | **lasthealthchecktime** | timestamp\
The oldest time that the health of the directory or any of its files or sub
directories' health was checked.

**aggregatemaxhealth** | **maxhealth** | float64\
This is the worst health when comparing stuck health vs health

**aggregatemaxhealthpercentage** | **maxhealthpercentage** | float64\
This is the `maxhealth` displayed as a percentage. Since health is the amount
of redundancy missing, files can have up to 25% of the redundancy missing and
still be considered 100% healthy.

**aggregateminredundancy** | **minredundancy** | float64\
The lowest redundancy of any file or directory in the sub directory tree

**mode** | unit32\
The filesystem mode of the directory. There is no corresponding aggregate
field for mode.

**aggregatemostrecentmodtime** | **mostrecentmodtime** | timestamp\
The most recent mod time of any file or directory in the sub directory tree

**aggregatenumfiles** | **numfiles** | uint64\
The total number of files in the sub directory tree

**aggregatenumstuckchunks** | **aggregatenumstuckchunks** | uint64\
The total number of stuck chunks in the sub directory tree

**aggregatenumsubdirs** | **numsubdirs** | uint64\
The number of directories in the directory

**aggregaterepairsize** | **repairsize** | uint64\
The total size in bytes that needs to be handled by the repair loop. This
does not include files that only have less than 25% of the redundancy missing
as the repair loop will ignore these files until they lose more redundancy.
This also does not include any stuck data.

**uplopath** | string\
The path to the directory on the uplo network. There is no corresponding
aggregate value for uplopath.

**aggregatesize** | **size** | uint64\
The total size in bytes of files in the sub directory tree

**aggregatestuckhealth** | **stuckhealth** | floatt64\
The health of the most in need stuck uplofile in the directory

**aggregatestucksize** | **stucksize** | uint64\
The total size in bytes that needs to be handled by the stuck loop. This does
include files that only have less than 25% of the redundancy missing as the
stuck loop does not take into account the health of the stuck file.

**UID** | string\
The unique identifier for the directory in the filesystem. There is no corresponding aggregate field for UID.

**aggregateskynetfiles** | **skynetfiles** | uint64\
The total number of skyfiles. This includes skyfile uploads and uplofile to
skyfile conversions.

**aggregateskynetsize** | **skynetsize** | uint64\
The total size in bytes that corresponds to a skyfile. This includes skyfile
uploads and uplofile to skyfile conversions.

**files** Same response as [files](#files)

**destination** | string  
Local path that the file will be downloaded to.  

**destinationtype** | string  
What type of destination was used. Can be "file", indicating a download to disk,
can be "buffer", indicating a download to memory, and can be "http stream",
indicating that the download was streamed through the http API.  

**length** | bytes  
Length of the download. If the download was a partial download, this will
indicate the length of the partial download, and not the length of the full
file.  

**offset** | bytes  
Offset within the file of the download. For full file downloads, the offset will
be '0'. For partial downloads, the offset may be anywhere within the file.
offset+length will never exceed the full file size.  

**uplopath** | string  
Uplopath given to the file when it was uploaded.  

**completed** | boolean  
Whether or not the download has completed. Will be false initially, and set to
true immediately as the download has been fully written out to the file, to the

there is an error that causes the download to fail.  

**endtime** | date, RFC 3339 time  
Time at which the download completed. Will be zero if the download has not yet
completed.  

**error** | string  
Error encountered while downloading. If there was no error (yet), it will be the
empty string.  

**received** | bytes  
Number of bytes downloaded thus far. Will only be updated as segments of the
file complete fully. This typically has a resolution of tens of megabytes.  

**starttime** | date, RFC 3339 time  
Time at which the download was initiated.

**totaldatatransferred** | bytes
The total amount of data transferred when downloading the file. This will
eventually include data transferred during contract + payment negotiation, as
well as data from failed piece downloads.

Length of the download. If the download was a partial download, this will
indicate the length of the partial download, and not the length of the full
file.  

**offset** | bytes  
Offset within the file of the download. For full file downloads, the offset will
be '0'. For partial downloads, the offset may be anywhere within the file.
offset+length will never exceed the full file size.  

**uplopath** | string  
Uplopath given to the file when it was uploaded.  

**completed** | boolean  
Whether or not the download has completed. Will be false initially, and set to
true immediately as the download has been fully written out to the file, to the
http stream, or to the in-memory buffer. Completed will also be set to true if
there is an error that causes the download to fail.  

**endtime** | date, RFC 3339 time  
Time at which the download completed. Will be zero if the download has not yet
completed.  

**error** | string  
Error encountered while downloading. If there was no error (yet), it will be the
empty string.  

**received** | bytes  
Number of bytes downloaded thus far. Will only be updated as segments of the
file complete fully. This typically has a resolution of tens of megabytes.  

**starttime** | date, RFC 3339 time  
Time at which the download was initiated.

**totaldatatransfered** | bytes  
The total amount of data transferred when downloading the file. This will
eventually include data transferred during contract + payment negotiation, as
well as data from failed piece downloads.  

## /renter/downloads/clear [POST]

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:8480/renter/downloads/clear?before=1551398400&after=1552176000"
```

Clears the download history of the renter for a range of unix time stamps.  Both
parameters are optional, if no parameters are provided, the entire download
history will be cleared.  To clear a single download, provide the timestamp for
the download as both parameters.  Providing only the before parameter will clear
all downloads older than the timestamp. Conversely, providing only the after
parameter will clear all downloads newer than the timestamp.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**before** | unix timestamp  
unix timestamp found in the download history

**after** | unix timestamp  
unix timestamp found in the download history

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/prices [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/renter/prices"
```

Lists the estimated prices of performing various storage and data operations. An
allowance can be submitted to provide a more personalized estimate. If no
allowance is submitted then the current set allowance will be used, if there is
no allowance set then sane defaults will be used. Submitting an allowance is
optional, but when submitting an allowance all the components of the allowance
are required. The allowance used to create the estimate is returned with the
estimate.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED or OPTIONAL
Allowance settings, see the fields [here](#allowance)

}
```
**files**  

**accesstime** | timestamp  
indicates the last time the uplofile was accessed

**available** | boolean  
true if the file is available for download. A file is available to download once
it has reached at least 1x redundancy. Files may be available before they have
reached 100% upload progress as upload progress includes the full expected
redundancy of the file.  

**changetime** | timestamp  
indicates the last time the uplofile metadata was updated

**ciphertype** | string  
indicates the encryption used for the uplofile

**createtime** | timestamp  
indicates when the uplofile was created

**expiration** | block height  
Block height at which the file ceases availability.  

**filesize** | bytes  
Size of the file in bytes.  

**health** | float64 health is an indication of the amount of redundancy missing
where 0 is full redundancy and >1 means the file is not available. The health of
the uplofile is the health of the worst unstuck chunk.

**localpath** | string  
Path to the local file on disk.  
**NOTE** `uplod` will set the localpath to an empty string if the local file is
not found on disk. This is done to avoid the uplofile being corrupted in the
future by a different file being placed on disk at the original localpath
location.  

**maxhealth** | float64  
the maxhealth is either the health or the stuckhealth of the uplofile, whichever
is worst

**maxhealthpercent** | float64  
maxhealthpercent is the maxhealth converted to be out of 100% to be more easily
understood

**modtime** | timestamp  
indicates the last time the uplofile contents where modified

**numstuckchunks** | uint64  
indicates the number of stuck chunks in a file. A chunk is stuck if it cannot
reach full redundancy

**ondisk** | boolean  
indicates if the source file is found on disk

**recoverable** | boolean  
indicates if the uplofile is recoverable. A file is recoverable if it has at
least 1x redundancy or if `uplod` knows the location of a local copy of the file.

**redundancy** | float64  
When a file is uploaded, it is first broken into a series of chunks. Each chunk
goes on a different set of hosts, and therefore different chunks of the file can
have different redundancies. The redundancy of a file as reported from the API
will be equal to the lowest redundancy of any of  the file's chunks.

**renewing** | boolean  
true if the file's contracts will be automatically renewed by the renter.  

**uplopath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.  

**stuck** | bool  
a file is stuck if there are any stuck chunks in the file, which means the file
cannot reach full redundancy

**stuckhealth** | float64  
stuckhealth is the worst health of any of the stuck chunks.

**uploadedbytes** | bytes  
Total number of bytes successfully uploaded via current file contracts. This
number includes padding and rendundancy, so a file with a size of 8192 bytes
might be padded to 40 MiB and, with a redundancy of 5, encoded to 200 MiB for
upload.  

**uploadprogress** | percent  
Percentage of the file uploaded, including redundancy. Uploading has completed
when uploadprogress is 100. Files may be available for download before upload
progress is 100.

**stuck** | bool  
if set a file will be marked as either stuck or not stuck by marking all of
its chunks.

**root** | bool  
Whether or not to treat the uplopath as being relative to the user's home
directory. If this field is not set, the uplopath will be interpreted as
relative to 'home/user/'.

responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/delete/*uplopath* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:8480/renter/delete/myfile"

only the entry in the renter. Will return an error if the target is a folder.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### OPTIONAL
**root** | bool  
Whether or not to treat the uplopath as being relative to the user's home

responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/download/*uplopath* [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/renter/download/myfile?httpresp=true"
```

downloads a file to the local filesystem. The call will block until the file has
been downloaded.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED (Either one or the other)
**destination** | string  
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

**httpresp** | boolean  
If httresp is true, the data will be written to the http response.

### OPTIONAL
**async** | boolean  
If async is true, the http request will be non blocking. Can't be used with
httpresp.

**disablelocalfetch** | boolean  
If disablelocalfetch is true, downloads won't be served from disk even if the
file is available locally.

**root** | boolean  
If root is true, the provided uplopath will not be prefixed with /home/user but is instead taken as an absolute path.

**length** | bytes  
Length of the requested data. Has to be <= filesize-offset.  

**offset** | bytes  
Offset relative to the file start from where the download starts.  

### Response

Unlike most responses, this response modifies the http response header. The
download will set the 'ID' field in the http response header to a unique
identifier which can be used to cancel an async download with the
/renter/download/cancel endpoint and retrieve a download's info from the
download history using the /renter/downloadinfo endpoint. Apart from that the
response is a standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/download/cancel [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/renter/download/cancel?id=<downloadid>"
```

cancels the download with the given id.

### Query String Parameters

ID returned by the /renter/download/*uplopath* endpoint. It is set in the http
header's 'ID' field.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/downloadsync/*uplopath* [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/renter/downloadasync/myfile?destination=/home/myfile"
```

downloads a file to the local filesystem. The call will return immediately.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**destination** | string  
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

### Response

## /renter/fuse [GET]
> curl example  

```bash
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/renter/fuse"
```

Lists the set of folders that have been mounted to the user's filesystem and
which mountpoints have been used for each mount.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "mountpoints": [ // []modules.MountInfo
    {
      "mountpoint": "/home/user/uplovideos", // string
      "uplopath": "/videos",                 // modules.UploPath

      "mountoptions": { // []modules.MountOptions
          "allowother": false, // bool
          "readonly": true,    // bool
        },
    },
  ]
}
```
**mountpoint** | string  
The system path that is being used to mount the fuse folder.

**uplopath** | string  
The uplopath that has been mounted to the mountpoint.

## /renter/fuse/mount [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:8480/renter/fuse/mount?readonly=true"
```

Mounts a Uplo directory to the local filesystem using FUSE.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**mount** | string  
Location on disk to use as the mountpoint.

**readonly** | bool  
Whether the directory should be mounted as ReadOnly. Currently, readonly is a
required parameter and must be set to true.

### OPTIONAL
**uplopath** | string  
Which path should be mounted to the filesystem. If left blank, the user's home
directory will be used.

**allowother** | boolean  
By default, only the system user that mounted the fuse directory will be allowed
to interact with the directory. Often, applications like Plex run as their own
user, and therefore by default are banned from viewing or otherwise interacting
with the mounted folder. Setting 'allowother' to true will allow other users to
see and interact with the mounted folder.

On Linux, if 'allowother' is set to true, /etc/fuse.conf needs to be modified so
that 'user_allow_other' is set. Typically this involves uncommenting a single
line of code, see the example below of an /etc/fuse.conf file that has
'use_allow_other' enabled.

```bash
# /etc/fuse.conf - Configuration file for Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)

# Set the maximum number of FUSE mounts allowed to non-root users.
# The default is 1000.
#mount_max = 1000

# Allow non-root users to specify the allow_other or allow_root mount options.
user_allow_other

curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "newuplopath=myfile2&root=true" "localhost:8480/renter/rename/myfile"
```

change the uploPath for a file that is being managed by the renter.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**newuplopath** | string  
New location of the file in the renter on the network.  

### OPTIONAL
**root** | bool  
Whether or not to treat the uplopath as being relative to the user's home

## /renter/stream/*uplopath* [GET]
> curl example  

```sh
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/renter/stream/myfile"
```  

> The file can be streamed partially by using standard partial http requests
> which means setting the "Range" field in the http header.  

```sh
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" "localhost:8480/renter/stream/myfile"
```

downloads a file using http streaming. This call blocks until the data is
received. The streaming endpoint also uses caching internally to prevent uplod
from re-downloading the same chunk multiple times when only parts of a file are
requested at once. This might lead to a substantial increase in ram usage and
therefore it is not recommended to stream multiple files in parallel at the
moment. This restriction will be removed together with the caching once partial
downloads are supported in the future. If you want to stream multiple files you
should increase the size of the Renter's `streamcachesize` to at least 2x the
number of files you are steaming.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### OPTIONAL
**disablelocalfetch** | boolean  
If disablelocalfetch is true, downloads won't be served from disk even if the
file is available locally.

**root** | boolean  
If root is true, the provided uplopath will not be prefixed with /home/user but is instead taken as an absolute path.

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/upload/*uplopath* [POST]

```

uploads a file to the network from the local filesystem.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Location where the file will reside in the renter on the network. The path must
be non-empty, may not include any path traversal strings ("./", "../"), and may
not begin with a forward-slash character.  

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**source** | string  
Location on disk of the file being uploaded.  

### OPTIONAL
**datapieces** | int  
The number of data pieces to use when erasure coding the file.  

**paritypieces** | int  
The number of parity pieces to use when erasure coding the file. Total
redundancy of the file is (datapieces+paritypieces)/datapieces.

## /renter/uploads/pause [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "duration=10m" "localhost:8480/renter/uploads/pause"
```

This endpoint will pause any future uploads or repairs for the duration
requested. Any in progress chunks will finish. This can be used to free up
the workers to exclusively focus on downloads. Since this will pause file
repairs it is advised to not pause for too long. If no duration is supplied
then the default duration of 600 seconds will be used. If the uploads are
already paused, additional calls to pause the uploads will result in the
duration of the pause to be reset to the duration supplied as opposed to
pausing for an additional length of time.

### Path Parameters
#### OPTIONAL 
**duration** | string  
duration is how long the repairs and uploads will be paused in seconds. If no
duration is supplied the default pause duration will be used.

### Response
standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/uploads/resume [POST]

## /skynet/basesector/*skylink* [GET]
> curl example  

```bash
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/skynet/basesector/CABAB_1Dt0FJsxqsu_J4TodNCbCGvtFf1Uys_3EgzOlTcg"
```  

downloads the basesector of a skylink using http streaming. This call blocks
until the data is received. There is a 30s default timeout applied to
downloading a basesector. If the data cannot be found within this 30s time
constraint, a 404 will be returned. This timeout is configurable through the
query string parameters.


### Path Parameters 
### Required
**skylink** | string  
The skylink of the basesector that should be downloaded.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL

**timeout** | int  
If 'timeout' is set, the download will fail if the basesector cannot be
retrieved before it expires. Note that this timeout does not cover the actual
download time, but rather covers the TTFB. Timeout is specified in seconds,
a timeout value of 0 will be ignored. If no timeout is given, the default will
be used, which is a 30 second timeout. The maximum allowed timeout is 900s (15
minutes).

### Response Body

The response body is the raw data for the basesector.

## /skynet/blocklist [GET]
> curl example

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/skynet/blocklist"
```

returns the list of hashed merkleroots that are blocked. 

NOTE: these are not the same values that were submitted via the POST endpoint.
This is intentional so that it is harder to find the blocked content.
	
NOTE: With v1.5.0 the return value for the Blocklist changed. Pre v1.5.0 the
[]crypto.Hash was a slice of MerkleRoots. Post v1.5.0 the []crypto.Hash is
a slice of the Hashes of the MerkleRoots

### Path Parameters
See [/skynet/skylink/skylink](#skynetskylinkskylink-get)

### Query String Parameters
See [/skynet/skylink/skylink](#skynetskylinkskylink-get)

### Response Header
See [/skynet/skylink/skylink](#skynetskylinkskylink-get)

### Response Body

This request has an empty response body.

## /skynet/skylink/*skylink* [GET]
> curl example  

> Stream the whole file.  

```bash
# entire file
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/skynet/skylink/CABAB_1Dt0FJsxqsu_J4TodNCbCGvtFf1Uys_3EgzOlTcg"

# directory
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/skynet/skylink/CABAB_1Dt0FJsxqsu_J4TodNCbCGvtFf1Uys_3EgzOlTcg/folder"

# sub file
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/skynet/skylink/CABAB_1Dt0FJsxqsu_J4TodNCbCGvtFf1Uys_3EgzOlTcg/folder/file.txt"
```  

downloads a skylink using http streaming. This call blocks until the data is
received. There is a 30s default timeout applied to downloading a skylink. If
the data cannot be found within this 30s time constraint, a 404 will be
returned. This timeout is configurable through the query string parameters.

In order to make sure skapps function correctly when they rely on relative paths
within the same skyfile, we need the skylink to be followed by a trailing slash.
If that is not the case the API responds with a redirect to the same skylink,
adding that trailing slash. This redirect only happens if the skyfile holds a 
skapp.

### Path Parameters 
### Required
**skylink** | string  
The skylink that should be downloaded. The skylink can contain an optional path.
This path can specify a directory or a particular file. If specified, only that
file or directory will be returned.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL

**attachment** | bool  
If 'attachment' is set to true, the Content-Disposition http header will be set
to 'attachment' instead of 'inline'. This will cause web browsers to download
the file as though it is an attachment instead of rendering it.

**format** | string  
If 'format' is set, the skylink can point to a directory and it will return the
data inside that directory. Format will decide the format in which it is
returned. Currently, we support the following values:  
 * 'concat' will return the concatenated data of all subfiles in that directory
 * 'tar' will return a tar archive of all subfiles in that directory
 * 'targz' will return a gzipped tar archive of all subfiles in that directory.  
 * 'zip' will return a zip archive
 
If the format is not specified, and the skylink points at a directory, we
default to the zip format and the contents will be downloaded as a zip archive.

**no-response-metadata** | string  
If 'no-response-metadata' is set to true, the API will not return the metadata
in the "Skynet-File-Metadata" response header. This might be useful in cases
where the metadata is not used, or where the size of the response header is
proving to be an issue.

**include-layout** | string  
If 'include-layout' is set to true, the API will return the layout in the
"Skynet-File-Layout" response header. In most cases the layout is not needed for
the download which is why it is not returned by default. Cases that require the
layout include backing up skylinks where all the original upload information
about a skylink is needed.

**timeout** | int  
If 'timeout' is set, the download will fail if the Skyfile cannot be retrieved 
before it expires. Note that this timeout does not cover the actual download 
time, but rather covers the TTFB. Timeout is specified in seconds, a timeout 
value of 0 will be ignored. If no timeout is given, the default will be used,
which is a 30 second timeout. The maximum allowed timeout is 900s (15 minutes).

### Response Header

**Skynet-File-Metadata** | SkyfileMetadata

The header field "Skynet-FileMetadata" will be set such that it has an encoded
json object which matches the modules.SkyfileMetadata struct. If a path was
supplied, this metadata will be relative to the given path.

**Skynet-Skylink** | string

The value of "Skynet-Skylink" is a string representation of the base64 encoded
Skylink that was requested.

**ETag** | string

The ETag response header contains a hash that can be supplied using the
"If-None-Match" request header. If that header is supplied, and if we find that
the requested data has not changed, uplod will respond with a '304 Not Modified'
response, letting the caller know it can safely reuse it previously cached
response data.

See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag for more
information on the ETag header.

### Response Body

The response body is the raw data for the file.

## /skynet/skyfile/*uplopath* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
// This command uploads the file 'myImage.png' to the Uplo folder
// 'var/skynet/images/myImage.png'. Users who download the file will see the name
// 'image.png'.
curl -A Uplo-Agent -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/skynet/skyfile/images/myImage.png" -F 'file=@image.png'

// This command uploads a directory with the local files `src/main.rs` and
// `src/test.c` to the Uplo folder 'var/skynet/src'.
curl -A Uplo-Agent -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/skynet/skyfile/src?filename=src" -F 'files[]=@./src/main.rs' -F 'files[]=@./src/test.c'
```

Uploads a file to the network using a stream. If the upload stream POST call
fails or quits before the file is fully uploaded, the file can be repaired by a
subsequent call to the upload stream endpoint using the `repair` flag.

It is also possible to upload a directory as a single piece of content using
multipart uploads. Doing this will allow you to address your content under one
skylink, and access the files by their path. This is especially useful for
webapps.

### Path Parameters
### REQUIRED
**uplopath** | string  
Location where the file will reside in the renter on the network. The path must
be non-empty, may not include any path traversal strings ("./", "../"), and may
not begin with a forward-slash character. If the 'root' flag is not set, the
path will be prefixed with 'var/skynet/', placing the skyfile into the Uplo
system's default skynet folder.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL
**basechunkredundancy** | uint8  
The amount of redundancy to use when uploading the base chunk. The base chunk is
the first chunk of the file, and is always uploaded using 1-of-N redundancy.

**convertpath** string  
The uplopath of an existing uplofile that should be converted to a skylink. A new
skyfile will be created. Both the new skyfile and the existing uplofile are
required to be maintained on the network in order for the skylink to remain
active. This field is mutually exclusive with uploading streaming.

**NOTE**: Converting uplofiles to skyfiles does not support skykey encryption.

**defaultpath** string  
The path to the default file whose content is to be returned when the skyfile is 
accessed at the root path. The `defaultpath` must point to a file in the root
directory of the skyfile (except for skyfiles with a single file in them). If
the `defaultpath` parameter is not provided, it will default to `index.html` 
for directories that have that file, or it will default to the only file in the 
directory, if a single file directory is uploaded. This behaviour can be 
disabled using the `disabledefaultpath` parameter. The two parameters are 
mutually exclusive and only one can be specified. Neither one is applicable to 
skyfiles without subfiles.

**disabledefaultpath** bool  
The `disabledefaultpath` allows to disable the default path behaviour. If this
parameter is set to `true`, there will be no automatic default to `index.html`,
nor to the single file in directory upload. This parameter is mutually exclusive
with `defaultpath` and specifying both will result in an error. Neither one is 
applicable to skyfiles without subfiles.

**filename** | string  
The name of the file. This name will be encoded into the skyfile metadata, and
will be a part of the skylink. If the name changes, the skylink will change as
well. The name must be non-empty, may not include any path traversal strings
("./", "../"), and may not begin with a forward-slash character. When uploading
a single file using multipart form upload (the recommended method), this
parameter is optional; the name will be taken from the filename of the only
subfile.

**dryrun** | bool  
If dryrun is set to true, the request will return the Skylink of the file
without uploading the actual file to the Uplo network.

**force** | bool  
If there is already a file that exists at the provided uplopath, setting this
flag will cause the new file to overwrite/delete the existing file. If this flag
is not set, an error will be returned preventing the user from destroying
existing data.

**mode** | uint32  
The file mode / permissions of the file. Users who download this file will be
presented a file with this mode. If no mode is set, the default of 0644 will be
used.

**root** | bool  
Whether or not to treat the uplopath as being relative to the root directory. If
this field is not set, the uplopath will be interpreted as relative to
'var/skynet'.


**skykeyname** | string  
The name of the skykey that will be used to encrypt this skyfile. Only the
name or the ID of the skykey should be specified.

**OR**

**skykeyid** | string  
The ID of the skykey that will be used to encrypt this skyfile. Only the
name or the ID of the skykey should be specified.


### Http Headers
### OPTIONAL
**Content-Disposition** | string  
If the filename is set in the Content-Disposition field, that filename will be
used as the filename of the object being uploaded. Note that this header is only
taken into consideration when using a multipart form upload.

For more details on setting Content-Disposition:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition

**Skynet-Disable-Force** | bool  
This request header allows overruling the behaviour of the `force` parameter
that can be passed in through the query string parameters. This header is useful
for Skynet portal operators that would like to have some control over the
requests that are being passed to uplod. To avoid having to parse query string
parameters and overrule them that way, this header can be set to disable the
force flag and disallow overwriting the file at the given uplopath.

### Response Header

**Skynet-Skylink** | string

The value of "Skynet-Skylink" is a string representation of the base64 encoded
Skylink that was uploaded.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
"skylink":    "CABAB_1Dt0FJsxqsu_J4TodNCbCGvtFf1Uys_3EgzOlTcg" // string
"merkleroot": "QAf9Q7dBSbMarLvyeE6HTQmwhr7RX9VMrP9xIMzpU3I" // hash
"bitfield":   2048 // int
}
```
**skylink** | string  
This is the skylink that can be used with the `/skynet/skylink` GET endpoint to
retrieve the file that has been uploaded.

**merkleroot** | hash  
This is the hash that is encoded into the skylink.

**bitfield** | int  
This is the bitfield that gets encoded into the skylink. The bitfield contains a
version, an offset and a length in a heavily compressed and optimized format.


## /skynet/stats [GET]
> curl example

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/skynet/stats"
```

returns statistical information about Skynet, e.g. number of files uploaded

### JSON Response
```json
{
  "uptime": 1234, // int
  "uploadstats": {
    "numfiles": 2,         // int
    "totalsize": 44527895  // int
  },
  "versioninfo": {
    "version":     "1.4.4-master", // string
    "gitrevision": "cd5a83712"     // string
  },
  "performancestats": {
  }
}
```

**uptime** | int  
The amount of time in seconds that uplod has been running.

**uploadstats** | object  
Uploadstats is an object with statistics about the data uploaded to Skynet.

**numfiles** | int  
Numfiles is the total number of files uploaded to Skynet.

**totalsize** | int  
Totalsize is the total amount of data in bytes uploaded to Skynet.

**versioninfo** | object  
Versioninfo is an object that contains the node's version information.

**version** | string  
Version is the uplod version the node is running.

**gitrevision** | string  
Gitrevision refers to the commit hash used to build uplod.

**performancestats** | object - api.SkynetPerformanceStats  
PerformanceStats is an object that contains a breakdown of performance metrics
for the skynet endpoints. Things are broken down into containers based on the
type of action performed. For example, there is a container for downloads less
than 64kb in size.

Within each container, there is a bucket of half lives. Every time a data point
is added to a container, it is put in to every bucket, counting up the total
number of requests. The buckets decay at the stated half life, which means they
give a good representation of how much activity there has been over twice their
halflife. So for the one minute bucket, the total number of datapoints in the
bucket is a good representation of how many things have happened in the past two
minutes.

Within each bucket, there are several fields. For example, the n60ms field
represents the number of requests that finished in under 60ms. There is an NErr
field which gets incremented if there is a failure that can be attributed to
uplod.

Every download request will go into the TimeToFirstByte container, as well as
the appropriate download container based on the size of the download. Within the
chosen containers, every bucket will have the same field incremented. The field
that gets incremented is the one that corresponds to the amount of time the
request took.

The performance stats fields are not protected by a compatibility promise, and
may change over time.

# Wallet

## /wallet [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/wallet"
```

Returns basic information about the wallet, such as whether the wallet is locked
or unlocked.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "encrypted":  true,   // boolean
  "unlocked":   true,   // boolean
  "rescanning": false,  // boolean

  "confirmedUplocoinbalance":     "123456", // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedoutgoingUplocoins": "0",      // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedincomingUplocoins": "789",    // hastings, big int

  "uplofundbalance":      "1",    // uplofunds, big int
  "Uplocoinclaimbalance": "9001", // hastings, big int

  "dustthreshold": "1234", // hastings / byte, big int
}
```
**encrypted** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet has been encrypted or not. If the wallet has not
been encrypted, then no data has been generated at all, and the first time the
wallet is unlocked, the password given will be used as the password for
encrypting all of the data. 'encrypted' will only be set to false if the wallet
has never been unlocked before (the unlocked wallet is still encryped - but the
encryption key is in memory).  

**unlocked** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently locked or unlocked. Some calls become
unavailable when the wallet is locked.  

**rescanning** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently rescanning the blockchain. This will
be true for the duration of calls to /unlock, /seeds, /init/seed, and
/sweep/seed.  

**confirmedUplocoinbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of Uplocoins, in hastings, available to the wallet as of the most recent
block in the blockchain.  

**unconfirmedoutgoingUplocoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of Uplocoins, in hastings, that are leaving the wallet according to the
set of unconfirmed transactions. Often this number appears inflated, because
outputs are frequently larger than the number of coins being sent, and there is
a refund. These coins are counted as outgoing, and the refund is counted as
incoming. The difference in balance can be calculated using
'unconfirmedincomingUplocoins' - 'unconfirmedoutgoingUplocoins'  

**unconfirmedincomingUplocoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of Uplocoins, in hastings, are entering the wallet according to the set of
unconfirmed transactions. This number is often inflated by outgoing Uplocoins,
because outputs are frequently larger than the amount being sent. The refund
will be included in the unconfirmed incoming Uplocoins balance.  

**uplofundbalance** | big int  
Number of uplofunds available to the wallet as of the most recent block in the
blockchain.  

**Uplocoinclaimbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of Uplocoins, in hastings, that can be claimed from the uplofunds as of the
most recent block. Because the claim balance increases every time a file
contract is created, it is possible that the balance will increase before any
claim transaction is confirmed.  

**dustthreshold** | hastings / byte, big int  
Number of Uplocoins, in hastings per byte, below which a transaction output
cannot be used because the wallet considers it a dust output.

```

Loads a v0.3.3.x wallet into the current wallet, harvesting all of the secret
keys. All spendable addresses in the loaded wallet will become spendable from
the current wallet.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**source**  
Path on disk to the v0.3.3.x wallet to be loaded.  

**encryptionpassword**  
Encryption key of the wallet.

> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/wallet/address"
```

Gets a new address from the wallet generated by the primary seed. An error will
be returned if the wallet is locked.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "address": "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab"

long hex strings.  

## /wallet/addresses [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/wallet/addresses"
```

Fetches the list of addresses from the wallet. If the wallet has not been
created or unlocked, no addresses will be returned. After the wallet is
unlocked, this call will continue to return its addresses even after the wallet
is locked again.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "addresses": [ // []hash
    "1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789ab",

## /wallet/backup [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:8480/wallet/backup?destination=/home/wallet-settings.backup"
```

Creates a backup of the wallet settings file. Though this can easily be done
manually, the settings file is often in an unknown or difficult to find
location. The /wallet/backup call can spare users the trouble of needing to find
their wallet file.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**destination**  
Path to the location on disk where the backup file will be saved.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/changepassword [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:8480/wallet/changepassword?encryptionpassword=<currentpassword>&newpassword=<newpassword>"
```

Changes the wallet's encryption key.  

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**encryptionpassword** | string  
encryptionpassword is the wallet's current encryption password or primary seed.


**newpassword** | string  
newpassword is the new password for the wallet.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/init [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "encryptionpassword=<password>&force=false" "localhost:8480/wallet/init"
```

Initializes the wallet. After the wallet has been initialized once, it does not
need to be initialized again, and future calls to /wallet/init will return an
error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password is
blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed.

### Query String Parameters
### OPTIONAL WALLET PARAMETERS
**encryptionpassword** | string  
Password that will be used to encrypt the wallet. All subsequent calls should
use this password. If left blank, the seed that gets returned will also be the
encryption password.  

**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is
the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

**force** | boolean  
When set to true /wallet/init will Reset the wallet if one exists instead of
returning an error. This allows API callers to reinitialize a new wallet.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "primaryseed": "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello"
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Wallet seed used to generate addresses that the wallet is able to spend.  

## /wallet/init/seed [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "seed=<seed>&encryptionpassword=<password>&force=false" "localhost:8480/wallet/init/seed"
```

Initializes the wallet using a preexisting seed. After the wallet has been
initialized once, it does not need to be initialized again, and future calls to
/wallet/init/seed will return an error. The encryption password is provided by
the api call. If the password is blank, then the password will be set to the
same as the seed. Note that loading a preexisting seed requires scanning the
blockchain to determine how many keys have been generated from the seed. For
this reason, /wallet/init/seed can only be called if the blockchain is synced.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED WALLET PARAMETERS
**seed** | string  
Dictionary-encoded phrase that corresponds to the seed being used to initialize
the wallet.  

### OPTIONAL
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seed [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "seed=<seed>" "localhost:8480/wallet/seed"
```

Gives the wallet a seed to track when looking for incoming transactions. The
wallet will be able to spend outputs related to addresses created by the seed.
The seed is added as an auxiliary seed, and does not replace the primary seed.
Only the primary seed will be used for generating new addresses.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
[Required Wallet Parameters](#required-wallet-parameters)

### OPTIONAL | string
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

seed that gets used to generate new addresses. This call is unavailable when the
wallet is locked.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is
the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

### JSON Response

generated but they will be more difficult to recover in the event of a lost
wallet file or encryption password.  

**allseeds**  
Array of all seeds that the wallet references when scanning the blockchain for
outputs. The wallet is able to spend any output generated by any of the seeds,
however only the primary seed is being used to generate new addresses.

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "encryptionpassword=<password>&keyfiles=/file1,/home/file2" "localhost:8480/wallet/uplogkey"
```

Loads a key into the wallet that was generated by uplog. Most uplofunds are
currently in addresses created by uplog.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**encryptionpassword**  
Key that is used to encrypt the uplog key when it is imported to the wallet.  

**keyfiles**  
List of filepaths that point to the keyfiles that make up the uplog key. There
should be at least one keyfile per required signature. The filenames need to be
comma separated (no spaces), which means filepaths that contain a comma are not
allowed.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard
responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/sign [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "<requestbody>" "localhost:8480/wallet/sign"
```

Signs a transaction. The wallet will attempt to sign each input specified. The
transaction's TransactionSignatures should be complete except for the Signature
field. If `tosign` is provided, the wallet will attempt to fill in signatures
for each TransactionSignature specified. If `tosign` is not provided, the wallet
will add signatures for every TransactionSignature that it has keys for.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**transaction**  
Raw transaction. The rest of the fields in the response are determined from this
raw transaction. It is left undocumented here as the processed transaction (the
rest of the fields in this object) are usually what is desired.

See types.Transaction in
https://github.com/uplo-tech/uplo/blob/master/types/transactions.go  

**transactionid**  
ID of the transaction from which the wallet transaction was derived.  

**confirmationheight**  
Block height at which the transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is
unconfirmed the height will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**confirmationtimestamp**  
Time, in unix time, at which a transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is
unconfirmed the timestamp will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**inputs**  
Array of processed inputs detailing the inputs to the transaction.  

**parentid**  
The id of the output being spent.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund represented by the input. Possible values are 'Uplocoin input' and
'uplofund input'.  

**walletaddress** | boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For inputs (outgoing money), the related address is
usually not important because the wallet arbitrarily selects which addresses
will fund a transaction.  

**value** | hastings or uplofunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the input.  

**outputs**  
Array of processed outputs detailing the outputs of the transaction. Outputs
related to file contracts are excluded.  

**id**  
The id of the output that was created.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund is represented by the output. Possible values are 'Uplocoin output',
'uplofund output', 'claim output', and 'miner payout'. Uplocoin outputs and claim
outputs both relate to Uplocoins.  

Uplofund outputs relate to uplofunds.  

Miner payouts point to Uplocoins that have been spent on a miner payout. Because
the destination of the miner payout is determined by the block and not the
transaction, the data 'maturityheight', 'walletaddress', and 'relatedaddress'
areleft blank.  

**maturityheight**  
Block height the output becomes available to be spent. Uplocoin outputs and
uplofund outputs mature immediately - their maturity height will always be the
confirmation height of the transaction. Claim outputs cannot be spent until they
have had 144 confirmations, thus the maturity height of a claim output will
always be 144 larger than the confirmation height of the transaction.  

**walletaddress** | boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For outputs (incoming money), the related address
field can be used to determine who has sent money to the wallet.  

**value** | hastings or uplofunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the output.  

## /wallet/transactions [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Uplo-Agent" "localhost:8480/wallet/transactions"
```

Returns a list of transactions related to the wallet in chronological order.

### Query String Parameters
### REQUIRED
**startheight** | block height  
Height of the block where transaction history should begin.

**endheight** | block height  
Height of of the block where the transaction history should end. If 'endheight'
is greater than the current height, or if it is '-1', all transactions up to and
including the most recent block will be provided.

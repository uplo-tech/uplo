## Jan 12, 2021:
### v1.0.1
**Key Updates**
- Adds `/skynet/root` GET request to allow downloading a specific sector of a skyfile
- allow for migrating registry to custom path
- extend `uploc renter` with optional currency conversion based on
    UPLO_EXCHANGE_RATE env variable
- Update health loop to batch bubbles by subtree instead of individual
    directories
- add RHP3 RPC for atomic contract renewal
- Add `/renter/clean` API route with `uploc renter clean` to remove lost files
 from renter. Also added `uploc renter lost` to view lost files that would be
 removed.

**Bugs Fixed**
- Fixed `uploadHead` panic related to streaming caused by bad condition check.
- Fixed debug code that checks for contract header corruption.
- Fixed bug in skyfile fanout encoding that allowed for encoding empty piece root hashes.

  master updates and on Uplo nightly executions.

blocked since `uploc skynet blocklist` returns a list of hashed merkleroots, so
the list cannot be visually verified.

 address OOM during large file repairs
